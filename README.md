🚀 **Voice Assistant Project** 💬
------------------------

**Tagline:** "Your personal voice assistant, at your service!"

**Description:**
Welcome to the Voice Assistant Project! 💡 This project aims to create a user-friendly, conversational AI-powered voice assistant that can perform various tasks, such as:

* Answering general knowledge questions
* Setting reminders and alarms
* Playing music and videos
* Controlling smart home devices (coming soon!)
* And much more! 🤩

The project uses various libraries and tools to achieve this goal, including but not limited to:
* `speech_recognition` for speech-to-text functionality
* `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech functionality
* `webbrowser` for opening URLs and controlling smart home devices
* `datetime` for scheduling reminders and alarms
* `os` for interacting with the operating system

**Features:**
Here are some of the key features of the Voice Assistant Project:

1. 📞 Conversational Interface: Users can interact with the voice assistant using natural language, and receive responses in a conversational tone.
2. 🕰️ Reminders and Alarms: Users can set reminders and alarms, and the voice assistant will notify them when the time comes.
3. 🎵 Music and Video Playback: Users can play music and videos using the voice assistant, and control playback using voice commands.
4. 📊 Task Management: Users can set and manage tasks, such as sending emails, making phone calls, and more.
5. 💻 System Information: The voice assistant can provide users with system information, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and more.
6. 📱 Smart Home Control: Users can control smart home devices, such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras.
7. 📝 Note Taking: Users can take notes using the voice assistant, and access them later.
8. 📊 Voice Command Recognition: The voice assistant can recognize and respond to voice commands, allowing users to control the system using voice.
